7. Project Information: 

1. Project Description and Objectives:
The Centralized Exchange Default Swaps (CXDS) project is a groundbreaking financial solution addressing risks in centralized cryptocurrency exchanges. CXDS enables users to create credit default swaps (CDS) for exchange deposits, offering protection against defaults while providing yield opportunities for CDS sellers. Its primary goals are to enhance financial security, restore user confidence, and establish a dynamic DeFi market for risk management.
Notable exchange defaults include Mt. Gox (2014), which lost 850,000 Bitcoins (~$450M), and FTX (2022), with an $8B shortfall, among others like Bitfinex (2016), Coincheck (2018), and QuadrigaCX (2019). While such failures highlight vulnerabilities, the broader ecosystem remains resilient. Of these, only Bitfinex and Coincheck remain operational, reflecting a 2:5 survival ratio. Despite these high-profile incidents, there are over 120 active exchanges globally, demonstrating overall stability in the market.
This environment creates a compelling opportunity for CXDS as a crypto asset insurance mechanism. By addressing the ongoing fear of fund loss and leveraging a proven demand for risk mitigation, CXDS can occupy a unique and critical role, enhancing trust and driving greater participation in the growing cryptocurrency ecosystem.

Arkreen Network is a Web3-powered digital infrastructure for globally distributed renewable energy resources, facilitating their connection and monetization to support carbon reduction applications.

Arkreen enables renewable energy generators to declare the amount of electricity they produce. In return, the network rewards these suppliers for their contributions, and provide them the ability to issue AREC (Arkreen Renewable Energy Certificate) assets in the form of AREC NFTs and ART tokens. AREC, the on-chain self-certified tokenized REC asset, can be easily integrated various Web3 applications and monetized within Web3 ecosystem.

Classic RECs face some issues of double counting, verification inefficiencies, limited accessibility and low consumer awareness. 

Our objective is to establish an innovative self-certified AREC issuance protocol and platform based on the trusted generation data from globally distributed renewable energy sources, enable global renewable energy producers to monetize REC assets, promote a paradigm shift from traditional RECs to tokenized RECs, and amplify the efforts of all Web3 community to contribute to mitigating global warming.



2. Success Potential: - Explain why your project is likely to succeed (consider market demand, technical feasibility, and team capability)
The CXDS project is uniquely positioned for success due to its alignment with market demand, technical feasibility, and the expertise of the Canza Finance team:
Market Demand: The cryptocurrency ecosystem continues to face significant risks from centralized exchange failures, evidenced by losses totaling billions of dollars. With over 120 active centralized exchanges globally, the demand for protective solutions like CXDS is clear and growing. CXDS addresses this need by providing deposit protection and yield opportunities, offering a compelling value proposition for a wide user base.
Technical Feasibility: CXDS is built on robust blockchain infrastructure, utilizing the HSK Testnet to ensure scalability, efficiency, and security. Its innovative "reverse zero-coupon swap" structure enables seamless integration into existing financial ecosystems while providing both user protection and market liquidity.
Industry Validation: The concept of CXDS has already been reviewed by top insurance underwriters who have expressed significant interest, further validating its relevance and potential.
Proven Team Expertise: The Canza Finance team has a strong track record in delivering impactful blockchain-based financial solutions. Notably, the team developed Baki Exchange, an infinite-liquidity FX protocol with over $1.1 million in trading volume, demonstrating their ability to create and scale innovative products.
Multidisciplinary Skills: The team combines expertise in blockchain development, decentralized finance, traditional finance, and market risk management. This diverse skill set ensures the seamless execution and operational success of CXDS, from concept to market rollout.

3. Mission Alignment: - Describe how your project aligns with Hashkey's goals
The CXDS project aligns seamlessly with HashKey Group’s mission to bridge Web3 and real-world economies while fostering a secure, inclusive, and transparent financial system. Key areas of alignment include:
Advancing Financial Security: CXDS directly addresses risks in centralized exchanges by offering a robust deposit protection mechanism. This aligns with HashKey’s focus on creating secure, trustworthy financial ecosystems and ensuring safety for users in the digital asset space.
Expanding Blockchain Integration: By leveraging HashKey Chain, CXDS promotes the adoption of blockchain infrastructure in real-world financial applications. This reflects HashKey’s vision of developing regulated platforms that integrate blockchain into traditional financial systems.
Driving Financial Inclusion: CXDS bridges the gap between traditional financial risk management tools and decentralized finance, expanding financial services to underserved markets. This complements HashKey’s mission to provide inclusive financial solutions through innovative technology.
Supporting HSK Token Utility: CXDS integrates HSK as a transactional medium, collateral option, and incentive tool, enhancing the token’s adoption and value within a growing ecosystem. This aligns with HashKey’s goal of positioning HSK as a vital component of its regulated Web3 infrastructure.

4. Innovation: - Highlight what makes your project unique or innovative
The CXDS project is highly innovative, offering unique features that differentiate it from traditional financial solutions:
Reverse Zero-Coupon Swap Structure: CXDS employs a novel mechanism where premiums are paid upfront, and collateral is locked until maturity or default. This ensures funds are always available for claims, providing enhanced security and reliability.
First-of-its-Kind for Centralized Exchanges: While credit default swaps are well-known in traditional finance, CXDS pioneers their use specifically for cryptocurrency exchange deposits, filling a critical gap in risk management.
Dual-Utility Design: CXDS offers benefits for both buyers and sellers. Buyers gain protection for their deposits, while sellers earn yield by providing collateral, creating a dynamic and balanced market ecosystem.
Seamless Blockchain Integration: Built on the HSK Testnet, CXDS leverages scalable blockchain infrastructure to provide secure, efficient, and transparent operations, ensuring technical robustness.
Market Accessibility: Designed for institutional and retail users, CXDS makes advanced financial instruments accessible to a broader audience, promoting financial inclusion and innovation.

5. Is it open source?
Currently, the CXDS project is not fully open source. However, specific components of the platform may be shared with the community as the project matures. This approach ensures transparency while maintaining the security and integrity of critical systems. Open-sourcing select features in the future could encourage collaboration and foster innovation within the DeFi and blockchain ecosystem specifically in regards to exchange integration and solutions as a service.
6. Free or fee-based for end users?
CXDS is a fee-based platform. Users purchasing credit default swaps (CDS) will incur a small transaction fee, typically 0.3% of the notional value covered. This fee structure ensures the platform's sustainability while providing value-added services, such as deposit protection and yield generation. The transparent and minimal fees make CXDS accessible and beneficial for both retail and institutional users.
7. Interoperability with the Hashkey ecosystem:
CXDS is designed to seamlessly integrate with the HashKey ecosystem. The platform leverages HashKey Chain, a Layer 2 blockchain, to enhance scalability, security, and transaction efficiency. Additionally, the HSK token is incorporated as a transactional medium, collateral option, and incentive tool within CXDS, driving its utility and adoption. This interoperability strengthens the connectivity between CXDS and HashKey’s infrastructure, expanding both ecosystems and delivering a cohesive user experience.
